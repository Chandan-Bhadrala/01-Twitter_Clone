Twitter Clone
# **My learning**

## **What I have learned or learning in this project.**

* I'm here learning to create UI on your own w/o following tutorial line by line. Thus writing HTML & CSS on your own.
    
* In this tutorial going further I intend to write logic too on my own.
    
* I'm here to learn how to write models & implement them & reasoning behind the structure of the model.
    
* Logic I believe, I can implement on my own too now.
    
* Will be practicing React-Redux state-management & React Query in this project too, by implementing it on my own.
    

## **TODO:**

1. Tutorial completed till 02:00:36.
    
2. Need to create Login Page with Auth JS.
    
3. Thus, will be learning Auth JS implementation from Chai aur Code YT channel.
    
4. After learning Auth JS will be back onto completing the Twitter Clone.
    
5. After that will be doing instagram clone too from Patel Mern Stack. Because his instagram clone had more complex or one may say bigger model structure.
    

## **After thoughts.**

* In coding world of Web Dev, what I felt is, creating models is utmost important part of the Web Dev world, rest (UI & Logics) can be easily implemented.
    
* Final Words, PRD & Data model structure is something of utmost important part in the Web Dev world.
    
* So need to grasp command on it.
